	<h2>Author's Note...</h2>

	<p>This page has been a long time coming.  I came up with the following metaphor 
	for anxiety 1-2 years ago.  I've shared it with a few people, and this year (2016) when 
	#BellLetsTalk popped up on my twitter feed, I thought - why not share?  I knew 
	I couldn't get it written up that day, but I made it a goal to post something 
	in the next few days. </p>
	<p>Apparently my brain really liked the idea, as I woke up in the 
	middle of the night with my mind going to town on how to write it.  As I was thinking 
	about the right words and cadence, another idea popped into my head - "This would be 
	more fun and memorable as a comic."  I went on a short vacation to New York 
	City last weekend, and spent a good chunk of Monday morning outlining and drawing; 
	I polished it off when I got home.  (In case you're wondering: comics are. a 
	lot. of work.  But totally worth it!)  </p>
	<p>So here we are - my little blog post gone a little out of hand.  
    As I hope is abundantly obvious, this is simply one way of looking at 
	the experience of anxiety.  It describes a little of my own experience, and 
	one of the ways I've dealt with it.  It may not be for everyone, but 
	I hope it's useful to some - either in understanding their own anxiety, 
	someone else's, and most importantly, treating yourself with kindness 
	and love.</p>
	<p>In some ways, this particular metaphor is outgrowing its usefuleness to me - 
	it strikes me now as a little too pat.  But that's just a sign of 
	growth (I hope) and moving on to the next thing.  Expect the next comic in 
	a year or two!  :)</p>

	<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

	<p>A big thanks to my comic enthusiast friends: Lydia, Katie, and Sandy.  If they hadn't 
	shared their love of comics/graphic novels with me, this comic definitely wouldn't exist!  A 
	roundabout hat-tip to Lynda Barry, whose <a href="http://www.amazon.com/One-Hundred-Demons-Lynda-Barry/dp/1570614598">One Hundred Demons</a> opened 
	my eyes to the power of comics to weave together the light and dark of our stories, 
	and to spark our creativity (<a href="http://wid.wisc.edu/profile/lynda-barry/">we
	also happen to work in the same building, some of the time</a>).  Dan Roam's book 
	<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Blah-What-When-Words-Dont/dp/1591844592">Blah 
	Blah Blah: What to Do When Words Don't Work</a> was also a subconscious inspiration 
	of sorts.   </p>
	<p>And of course, thanks to the many friends, my family, and counselors who 
	have walked alongside me, listened to me vent, whine, and provided supportive 
	shoulders.  I recently read <i>Will and Spirit</i> by Gerald May and I think 
	he sums it up well: "At the outset, 
	before anything else, 'I can do it' must be replaced by 'I cannot do it alone.'"  </p>
