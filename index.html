		Welcome to Christina Koch's website!  
		I like to term myself a "21st-century Renaissance woman" -- thinker, educator, reader, 
		writer, musician, dancer, programmer, problem-solver, athlete, mathematician, and general enthusiast.  <br><br> 
		
		For me, there's no short answer to the question "Where are you from?"  Born in Chicago, 
		my family moved three times in my childhood, finally ending up in the town of El Segundo, 
		California where I attended middle and high school.  Thanks to diverse academic interests 
		and family roots in the Midwest, I headed to Minnesota for my undergraduate experience, 
		attending St. Olaf College, where I graduated summa cum laude with a Bachelor of 
		Arts in mathematics, and also found time to study abroad in Budapest, Hungary, play and tour with the 
		St. Olaf Band and St. Olaf Orchestra, and participate in a two-year great books program.  
		After graduation, I spent a year
		working at an adult education non-profit in Washington, DC, teaching adult basic education 
		courses in math and writing.  Arriving in Vancouver in 2010, I earned a 
		Graduate Diploma of Christian Studies at Regent College, and, in a complete u-turn of 
		subject material, a Master of Science in mathematics at the University of British Columbia.  I spent a year and a half 
		after graduate school working for <a href="http://rasullearning.ca">Rasul Learning Group</a>
		and volunteering with <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry</a>, the 
		<a href="http://wiki.ubc.ca/Science:Math_Exam_Resources">Math 
		Exam/Educational Resources wiki</a> and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/CreativiTea/">CreativiTea</a>.  In 
		November 2014, I moved to Madison, WI to take up a position as a Research Computing Facilitator
		at the University of Wisconsin.
