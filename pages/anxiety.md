<p> This page contains a comic about anxiety.  It describes a little of my 
own experience, and 
one of the ways I've come to understand anxiety and how to deal with it.  It 
may not be for everyone, but 
I hope it's useful to some - in understanding their own anxiety, 
someone else's, or most importantly, treating yourself with kindness 
and love.  </p>

<h2>Author's Note...</h2>

<p>This page has been a long time coming.  I came up with the previous metaphor 
for anxiety 1-2 years ago.  I've shared it with a few people, and this year (2016) when 
#BellLetsTalk popped up on my twitter feed, I thought - why not share?  I knew 
I couldn't get it written up that day, but I made it a goal to post something 
in the next few days. </p>
<p>Apparently my brain really liked the idea, as I woke up in the 
middle of the night with my mind going to town with the idea.  And as I was thinking 
about the right words and cadence, another idea popped into my head - "this would be 
more fun and memorable as a comic."  I went on a short vacation to New York 
City in February 2016, and spent a good chunk of the trip outlining and drawing; 
I polished it off when I got home.  (In case you're wondering: comics are. a 
lot. of work.  But totally worth it!)  </p>
<p>So here we are - my little blog post gone a little out of hand. 	In some ways, 
I've outgrown this metaphor - 
it strikes me now as a little too pat.  But that's just a sign of 
growth (I hope) and moving on to the next thing.  Expect the next comic in 
a year or two!  :)</p>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>A big thanks to my comic enthusiast friends: Lydia, Katie, and Sandy.  If they hadn't 
shared their love of comics/graphic novels with me, this comic definitely wouldn't exist!  A 
roundabout hat-tip to Lynda Barry, whose <a href="http://www.amazon.com/One-Hundred-Demons-Lynda-Barry/dp/1570614598">One Hundred Demons</a> opened 
my eyes to the power of comics to weave together the light and dark of our stories, 
and to spark our creativity (<a href="http://wid.wisc.edu/profile/lynda-barry/">we
also happen to work in the same building, some of the time</a>).  Dan Roam's book 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Blah-What-When-Words-Dont/dp/1591844592">Blah 
Blah Blah: What to Do When Words Don't Work</a> was also a subconscious inspiration 
of sorts.   </p>
<p>And of course, thanks to the many friends, my family, and counselors who 
have walked alongside me, listened to me vent, whine, and provided supportive 
shoulders.  In <i>Will and Spirit</i> Gerald May sums it up well: "At the outset, 
before anything else, 'I can do it' must be replaced by 'I cannot do it alone.'"  </p>
