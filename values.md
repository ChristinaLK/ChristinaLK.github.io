### Values

Our common welfare should come first; personal progress for the greatest number depends upon unity.
All of us or none
Body metaphor // working as for the Lord and not for men

## Positions

Right to protest
Rule of law
Liberal arts before it was cool

Science + technology

### Causes

Causes that I feel personally close to include:

* Mental health, especially around addiction and recovery
* Anti-sexism: accepting the evidence and research of structural inequality, believing and supporting women and chipping away at cultures of toxic masculinity
* Mathematical and financial literacy
